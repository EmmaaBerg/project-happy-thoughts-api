# Project Happy Thoughts API

The project for this week was to use Express and MongoDB to build an API for a previous frontend project Happy Thoughts. The API have endpoints for both GET- and POST request. 

## The problem
For this project we got a lot of help in both how to structure and what the endpoints should contain since we already did a frontend for this project in week 11 (Happy Thoughts). The purpose was to add the new API url in that project with the one created this week.
